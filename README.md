## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of the outcomes based on launch dates

### Analysis of the outcomes based on goals 

### Challenges and difficulties were line graph on the analysis of the based-on goals. Due to running a Mac OS there is no filters on the graph that you get with the windows OS. To overcome I had to only select the data that was need for the graph to display the desired results.  

## Results

- The Two conclusions I could draw from the data on Outcomes based on launch date is as fallowed. First that most fundraising campaigns start in May with the highest success rate. The second is that end of the year has a steady declined in success rates for campaigns.

- Bases on the Outcomes based on goals the campaigns that had a goal of less than $5,000 faired the best. We also see a good amount of goals met in the $35,000 - $44,999 at 67% with the second lowest failed range.

- Some limitations to this data are that we need to match the successful and failed to the goal amount to get a more pinpoint timeline of the best outcome. We also would need to take the data a bit further and the country targeted for date to show if it will work in the region that the campaign is to be hosted. 

- On the Theater outcome based on launch date we could add the percent Successful, Failed, and Canceled to show how much of a difference is for total campaigns for each month. We could have done a chart to relay the relation between the launch dates and goal amount.
